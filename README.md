## Take The Source Code

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/mazmik25/PostMe.git
```

Make sure you're using the latest Xcode (mine was Xcode 12.5)

## Challenge
Implementing **SwiftLint** \
In the first step, you will learn how to implement swiftlint into your project. You can check the configuration [here](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).
For the solution, you can check it [here](https://github.com/mazmik25/PostMe/tree/enhancement/add_swiftlint)

## Definition of Done
If you install it properly in the codebase, you can see some warnings appear on the left side of your Xcode

Actually the warnings just a warning. It tells you that our codes isn't 'Swiftly' enough. We can ignore it, or try to remove the warnings by following the instruction given in each warning. You can also setup some rules to be satified by SwiftLint. Check it [here](https://www.donnywals.com/enforcing-code-consistency-with-swiftlint/)
